                    Welcome to this website. The purpose if this site is to allow user to search the 
                    weather. It can be very helpful to know if it is raining without looking outside 
                    of a window. It can be even more helpful knowing if it raining cats and down on 
                    the other side of the world. Please go to the weather section and provide a 
                    location to discover what awaits outside. If you need any help please visit our 
                    help section.
